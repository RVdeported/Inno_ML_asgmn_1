The repository is created for Assignment 1 on Machine Learning course in Innopolis University.

Key findings and observations are stated in the Report.pdf file. File Main.ipynb is a support Jupyter-Notebook file with details on models' training and evaluation. In the Report.pdf file it is reffered as "Jupyter-Notebook". To run the Jupyter-Notebook file appropriately you need to complete the following steps:
    1. Download two datasets available at https://www.dropbox.com/s/ggim3akt5yjoexb/bitrate_prediction.zip?dl=1 and https://www.dropbox.com/s/rzbd2vfgmvd9opw/stream_quality_data.zip?dl=1.
    2. Ensure that Python 3.5 or higher is installed on your machine.
    3. Restore Anaconda environment stored in environment.yaml file or install the listed in the file dependencies manually.
Some observations are not included into Report.pdf file as the required size of the paper is 2 pages or less.
